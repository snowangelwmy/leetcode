/**
 * Test cases:
 * 1: Input: [1,2,3], [1,1]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3.
 * And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
 * You need to output 1.
 * 2: Input: [1,2], [1,2,3]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2.
 * You have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children,
 * You need to output 2.
