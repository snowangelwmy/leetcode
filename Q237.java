/**
 * Test cases:
 * Linked list: 4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 9
 * 1: Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
 * Output: [4,1,9]
 * Explanation: You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list
 *              should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.
 * 2: Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1
 * Output: [4,5,9]
 * Explanation: You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list
 *              should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.
 *
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
