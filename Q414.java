/**
 * Test cases:
 * 1: Input: [3, 2, 1]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: The third maximum is 1.
 * 2: Input: [1, 2]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The third maximum does not exist, so the maximum (2) is returned instead.
 * 3: Input: [2, 2, 3, 1]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: Note that the third maximum here means the third maximum distinct number.
 * Both numbers with value 2 are both considered as second maximum.
 * 4: Input: [1,2,2,5,3,5]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: Note that the third maximum here means the third maximum distinct number.
 * Both numbers with value 5 are both considered as maximum, and both numbers with value 2 are both considered as third maximum.
